# teen_high_game
A small terminal game, created for a Codecademy course.

It's a (sort of) rogue-like high school simulator, where you go to class, raise your traits (physique, focus, and creativity)
and make friends who help you reaise your popularity and have study sessions in the library.

If you'd like to play the game, download the repository and run the main.py file from the terminal.

#----------------------------- Things that need to be added ---------------------------------#

Pretty much half the game.

CLUBS
  I still have a bunch of ideas around adding clubs where you can hangout after the school day and do club activites.
  These would be little mini-games potentially, that could help your popularity, and also raise your friendship scores.
  This is also where I intended for the traits to become relevant. Right now, they serve no purpose, but give some points
  at the end.
 
HOBBIES
  I want to add more functionality to the hobbies, and especially a way to add more of them to your player,
  so that you have a bigger chance of becoming friends with your classmates.
 
DATES
  I want you to be able to ask NPCs out on dates, and get rejected, which would give you a penalty, or succeed which would
  help your popularity, and also add a lot of points to the end game.
  
CAFETERIA
  There needs to be a cafeteria at some point where there are different tables and you can choose to try and sit at
  the most popular, but it's a risky game of "are they gonna let you, or will you be humiliated?" I think there's
  a lot of fun that could be added to the cafeteria. 
  
DIALOGUE
  I want to add Dialogue to most interactions, and I've already started working on the implementation, however it's
  only gonna be sporadic at this point, so I'm holding off rolling it out until I can do it on a bigger scale.
  I want each potential dialogue piece to be randomly generated based on situation and the NPCs attitude and popularity.
